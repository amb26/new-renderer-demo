#### Textfield Control Renderer Component

This packages a version of the TextfieldSlider and TextfieldStepper components rewritten to the "intermediate new renderer" - 
that is, using new renderer primitives but still using standard jQuery bindings for live events, packaged as a new
"Infusion Renderer Component Package". This augments the standard package.json file with metadata suitable for
locating and mounting resources within the package.
